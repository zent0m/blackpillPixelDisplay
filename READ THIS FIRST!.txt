Congratulations on your STM32 Pixel Art Display thingy! I hope you have fun with it!

To get started, I will suggest you first watch the Installation Video, and then the Uploading Video.

If you want something a bit rough but quick, you can read the txt files for the instructions.
The installation instructions txt has an important link that is used in the video, however.

I have some Empty sketches inside the Image and Animation Sketch folders that have the main files that
run the whole show. I have commented the code a lot so that you have the least difficulty trying to 
read it.

I also included some example sketches in the Examples folder, so that you can either create your own
by taking a look at those, or just run them anyway.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind, OLED screens are inherently susceptible to burn-in, where an image gets
permanently burned into the screen if it is turned on for too long (and by too long I mean days, weeks, months)
To prevent that, either only run animations if you plan on keeping the display turned on, or turn off
the display (unplug it) when not in use.
Also, from what I've heard, this device has 256KB of Memory. Try to keep the amount of frame data under
that amount, because I have no idea what happens if we exceed that amount. It will probably not allow
flashing something larger than that, but just to be safe.

Have fun!
